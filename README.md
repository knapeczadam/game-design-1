# 🎲 Game Design 1 — The Rotator (2023)

Hey DAE student, reviewer, or curious visitor 👋  
Welcome to the **Game Design 1** repository — a focused prototype called **The Rotator**, created as part of the Game Design 1 course at **Digital Arts & Entertainment (Howest), Kortrijk**.

---

## 🗂️ About this repository

This repo holds an **Unreal Engine** prototype developed during the **Game Design 1** course. It was created as an iterative design exercise: the team started from board-game prototyping and moved to a digital prototype, using playtesting feedback to shape mechanics and player experience.

This upload serves as an **archive** of the prototype, design intent, and the packaged build for quick testing.

> ⚠️ Note: this project is a student prototype — expect experimental design, rough edges, and intentional constraints used to drive creativity. Consider this a snapshot of the design process, not a production release.

## 🧠 Learning Goals (selected)

**LR02** — Teamwork & Communication  
- Communicate design ideas clearly, both written and oral.  
- Function in a multidisciplinary team and reflect on personal contribution.

**LR04** — Research & Sources  
- Collect and analyze reference materials and apply practice-based research.

**LR05** — Critical Reflection  
- Critically evaluate own and others’ work; iterate using feedback.

**LR07** — Practical Game Development  
- Validate concepts with stakeholder feedback and iterative prototyping.  
- Understand historical, social and cultural contexts of a game.

## 🧩 Course Content & Focus

Game Design 1 emphasises:
- Iterative prototyping (board game → digital prototype)  
- Rapid playtesting and feedback loops  
- Concept-to-digital translation and core mechanic validation  
- Player experience, balancing, and constraint-driven creativity

This project specifically explores how a global mechanical constraint (frequent rotation) changes navigation, visibility, and player decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Releases

Packaged release available in the Releases tab:

`game_design_1-the_rotator-1.0.0-windows-x64.zip`

Use this to quickly run the prototype on Windows x64 for testing and demonstration.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This repository documents an exercise in constraint-led design: how a simple mechanical rule can reframe level design, player decision-making, and emotional tone. It’s an artefact of iterative design practice — use it as a reference for prototyping, playtest methodology, and translating analog design into interactive systems.
