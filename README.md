# 🎲 Game Design 1  

Hey DAE student, reviewer, or curious visitor 👋  
Welcome to the **Game Design 1** repository — a focused prototype called **The Rotator**, created as part of the Game Design 1 course at **DAE**.

## 🗄️ About this repository

The design theme — **“Villain”** — and the mechanical constraint — **“Everything in the level rotates every 5–15 seconds”** — were **randomly assigned** as part of the assignment brief. It was developed as an **iterative design exercise**, beginning with a **board game prototype** that was later translated into a **digital game concept**.  

This upload serves as an **archive** of the prototype, design intent, and the packaged build for quick testing.

> ⚠️ Note: this project is a student prototype — expect experimental design, rough edges, and intentional constraints used to drive creativity. Consider this a snapshot of the design process, not a production release.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Game Design 1 was a great reminder that **creativity grows from constraints** — even when your entire level starts spinning every few seconds!  
Working solo meant balancing design, mechanics, and iteration on my own, but it also made every improvement feel like a small victory.  

If you’re going through DAE: **experiment boldly**, **embrace feedback**, and remember that even failed ideas move you forward 💡🌀
